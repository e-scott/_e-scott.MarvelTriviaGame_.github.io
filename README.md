This was created to challenge me to testing what I have learned of javascript and jquery so far.

You have 15 questions that are Marvel themed. You have 15 seconds to answer a question.
If you get the answer right you get a 5 second message that says great job, then the next question comes up.
If you get the answer wong, you get a 5 second mesage telling you the correct answer before the next question.

Your score will be displayed at the end in 3 categories, Correct answers, incorrect answers, and unanswered.

Once the game is completed you can hit the start over button and try again.
